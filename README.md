MUST HAVE TO MAKE:
- Python 3.10+
- *pip install py2exe*
- setup.py (linked)
- browser.py (linked)
- command terminal (**CMD WORKED BEST FOR ME**)
INSTRUCTIONS

1. open cmd and enter ```pip install py2exe``` if you haven't already
2. put *browser.py* and *setup.py* in the **same directory**. or better yet, put them in the **same folder**
3. **MAKE SURE TO REPLACE *"my_web_browser.py"* with "*browser.py*"
4. open cmd again and enter ```python setup.py py2exe```
5. find the new .exe in the *build* folder (located in the directory with the *browser* & *setup* py files
6. pin the .exe file so you don't have to go searching again
7. enjoy!
